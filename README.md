### Zig Programming Language

Zig is a modern, general-purpose Programming designed to simpler, safer and more effective alternative to C. It aims to provide low-level control with high-level like convenience. Its appealing for systems-programming like Operating Systems, Embedded devices or performance critical applications and still be usable for broader development areas from Game development to Web development.

There’s no hidden control flow, no preprocessor, and no macros—unlike C, which relies heavily on those. Instead, Zig uses a feature called "comptime" for compile-time code execution, letting you do things like generics or metaprogramming without extra syntax baggage. For example, you can write a function that works with any type, and the compiler figures it out at build time, keeping the runtime lean.

Zig has manual memory management like that of C, but has tools and features in the compiler that makes it less prone to errors.

In short, Zig is a programming language like that of C without C's disadvantges
